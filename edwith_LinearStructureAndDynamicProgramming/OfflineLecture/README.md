The codes were originally given with several blanks to be filled by students.    
Also, the codes were designed to work with other 'main.py' codes and input data.    
However, as the matter of size of input data, I put only the solved codes which is filled the blanks.    
Therefore, the codes won't work properly.    
If you need more information about the code, please visit https://www.edwith.org/datastructure-2019s/lecture/58913 and check '코드실습'
